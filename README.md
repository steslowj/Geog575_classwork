# Geog575_classwork
A repo for my UW-Madison Geog 575: Interactive Cartography class assignments.

This repo contains:
- Unit 1: A simple example of a repo file structure for a website
- Unit 2: A website that explores US Air Quality Index Data with Leaflet.JS
- Unit 3: A website practicing interactive linking of visual elements with D3.JS

My final project for Geog 575 is a dashboard website that explores environmental data in the Mississippi River Watershed, and is presented in its own repo: [575 Final Project](https://github.com/steslowj/2023_Geog575_FinalProject).
